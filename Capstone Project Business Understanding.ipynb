The goal of this project is to help someone who wants to open a shop/business in Toronto determine a suitable location to open there business. By leveraging data science and the Foursquare API they can be provided with details about existing and competing businesses and position their new shop/business accordingly.\n\n### Some of the business requirements of this project include:\n### - Determining the top 10 most popular venues in a given neighbourhood\n### - Categorizing and providing data on particular venues such as Restaurants, Parks etc. \n### - Producing the locations of the produced venues as required\n### - Producing information specific to the category of shop/business that the stakeholder is trying to create\n### - and more\n\n### So for this project the stakeholders are business owners looking for locations for their new business/shop. The information generated and produced by this project could also be of interest to various industries. Given the nature of this project and business requirements, we will be choosing a descriptive analytic approach\n\n\n"
